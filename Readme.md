## Overview

### BackEnd

### FrontEnd

## Installation

### Important!

We highly recommend using the node version that is specified in the .nvmrc files (16.14.0) and the yarn package manager.

### BackEnd

Go to the folder <b>back</b> and start the dev environment with

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Or:
yarn
yarn run dev
```

If you wish you can also run the jest tests with:

```bash
npm run test
# Or:
yarn run test
```

There is also the possibility of launching ready to production. In this case it will be created a 'build' folder in the directory with the code compiled into javascript.

```bash
npm start
# Or:
yarn start
```

There is a swagger route once you start the server with how to use the api. Just go to '.../swagger' and you should be able to see how to call the api.

## FrontEnd

Go to the folder <b>front</b> and start the dev environment with

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Or:
yarn
yarn run dev
```

If you wish you can also run the jest tests with:

```bash
npm run test
# Or:
yarn run test
```

There is also the possibility of launching ready to production. In this case it will be created a '.next' folder in the directory with the code compiled into javascript.

```bash
npm run build
npm start
# Or:
yarn run build
yarn start
```
